# Approaches for Training the Siamese Network
To train the Siamese network, two separate approaches were used, named **bioinf_code** and **paper_code**:

- **bioinf_code**: code from a previous project, adapted for the needs of this research. This code was reused to exploit functionality already developed, readjusting it for the specific context of this study.

- **paper_code**: implementation based on an existing paper, with which part of the Siamese network architecture was integrated, in particular the methods for calculating distance and similarity between data representations. You can consult the original source code of the paper here: [siamese-network-for-IDS](https://github.com/AbertayMachineLearningGroup/siamese-network-for-IDS/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).

Full experiments were conducted using **paper_code**, which provided a more robust framework for evaluating the performance of the Siamese network in the context of attack detection.
