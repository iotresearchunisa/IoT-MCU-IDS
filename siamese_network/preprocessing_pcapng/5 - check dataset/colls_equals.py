"""
This Python script analyzes CSV files within a specified directory, with the following key functionalities:

1. **Check for Malformed Rows**:
   - The script examines each CSV file to detect rows where the number of columns differs from the expected number (determined by the first row).
   - Any malformed rows (i.e., rows with missing or extra columns) are reported along with the row number and content for easier debugging.

2. **Identify Empty or Zero-Filled Columns**:
   - It identifies columns across all CSV files that are completely empty, filled with zeros (`0`), or contain only `NaN` or `False` values.
   - The script checks each CSV file and flags columns that are empty or zero-filled consistently across all the files analyzed.

3. **Generate a Final Report**:
   - After processing all CSV files, the script generates a report listing columns that are entirely empty or contain only zeros, `NaN`, or `False` values across all CSV files.

4. **Handles Errors Gracefully**:
   - The script includes error handling to gracefully skip problematic files and report any issues encountered during file processing.

5. **Processes CSV Files in Chunks**:
   - The script reads and processes large CSV files in chunks to handle memory efficiently and work with large datasets.
